StepI: Understand What are Agents
Agent Nectir?: An AI model capable of reasoning, planning and interacting with its
environment

$\rightarrow$ An agent is a system that basnges on AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve
a user defined objective It combines reasoning (red groun) planning and the executions of (open proollectron) actions (after via external tools) A fuffil hacks.
Agents have two main parts:
1 The brain: AI model $\rightarrow$ where all the thinking happens (framing and plening a new)
2 The body: Eung thing agent is equipped with
Tend O3ellilferi
(4) Agent workflow: Think $\rightarrow$ Act $\rightarrow$ Observe
(long tools)
$\rightarrow$ Perception (Alytima): Cevresinden veri to plar
$\rightarrow$ Decision Making: Verigl malis ederek on yyi atigona belirler
$\rightarrow$ Action / Execution (Efellesim): Cevresini doplothirecel egloride bulunur
$\rightarrow$ Ggromme Metang: Doyisicllibere usism anjlar ve obesimlesinden dors ubarn
(3) LLM is the most common AI model in agents

Design of the tools is very important and has a great impact on the quality of agent

Agent interacts with its environment suitable for real-life usage

$\rightarrow$ To Summarize Aged is a system that uses AI model (generally LLM) as its core reasoning engine, is:
-Understand nathmal language: Interpret and respond

- Reason and plan: Analyge, make decisions, devise strategies for problem solving
-Interact with its environment: Take actions and observe results

Step II - Learn what are LLMs and Messages System
Each agent needs an AI model and LLM is the most common one.
LLM Type of AI model that erods of understanding and generating human natural language.
Tritted with test amounts of text data $\Rightarrow$ Learns patterns, structure, nuance With new actions of parameters

A single Decealing Loop

- Who input text takeiand, model computes a representation of the sequence that captures information about the moving and position
- Who this representation goes to the model, outputs scores that rank of each token as being the best one of each token.

Based on the scores there is multiple strategies to select tokens
4 Always take token with maximum score
A Shortion is all you need. Who predicting rest word not easy word is a sentence is equally impor bend $\Rightarrow$ Key aspect of Tenshore
The capital of Fronce is
$\rightarrow$ Carry the most moving $\Rightarrow$ Identifying the most relevant words
Context might - Refers to maximum number of token the LLM can process, and the maximum attention open it has
Reducing the next token by looking at every input token does $\Rightarrow$ Your First input sentence is very important

How are LLMs Trained?
Trained on large text detnecks, through a self-supervised or marked language modeling objective.

## What are Tools?

At ageis the ability to telpe or have, this happens via togle.
A tool is a function plus to the LLM. (Shadd fufitio a ciber objective)
Lo Shadd be something find complements the power of so LLM
3) If the egan needs up-to-date sides we must provide it through some tool.
A tool should contain:
"A reshed charipien of function
to A calder
to Arguments with Ipringe
to Outputs with Ipringe (Iytend)
